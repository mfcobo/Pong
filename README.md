Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left side of the screen, and can compete against either a computer-controlled opponent or another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth. The aim is for each player to reach three points before the opponent; points are earned when one fails to return the ball to the other.

Controls:
=============================
 Player 1 :
    W and S
    Shrink  E
    Smash   D

 Player 2 :

Game Mechanics:
  - The game will be a race to get the first 3 points.
  - Speed of the ball increases every 5 turns.
  - Player can only smash if the ball is VERY near the racquet.
  - Shrink power up allows your opponent's racquet to shrink.
